# The C Programming Language
This repository maintains the my answers to the exercises in the book, [The C programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language). It's a well known book written by [Brain Kernighan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan) and [Dennis Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie).

The first edition is published in 1978. C was actually created by one of the author, [Dennis Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie). The version of C described in the first version is called K&R C.
After ten years, the second edition was published and the ANSI C standard was added in to its content.
There maybe errors or mistakes in the my code, so I welcome everybody to leave a message or suggestion in any way. Thanks!
